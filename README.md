This repository no longer stores the generated `geo_auction_flutter.zip` archive under version control.
If you need to bundle the Flutter project for distribution, create the archive locally with:

```bash
zip -r geo_auction_flutter.zip geo_auction_flutter
```

This command should be run from the repository root and will package the `geo_auction_flutter/` directory into a
fresh ZIP file as needed.
